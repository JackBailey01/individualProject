MySQl Justification-Due to only having 3 very defined fields in this application I thought it was best to be using an sql database, as there is no need to be storing large amounts of extra data which is better suited to a NoSQL database. I choose MySQL as it is the SQL database that i am most familiar with.
Docker Justification-My intent was to use docker to lauch the entire application, however i was only able to get the database fully working in docker. I still continued to use docker though even with just the database as it is a very convienant method when it comes to moving machine, as very little is needed to setup and launch a MySQL server in docker. For this reason and the fact that i was constantly moving machines during this project, I choose to employ docker.
